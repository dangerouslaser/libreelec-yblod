# Exact versions

These are the release inputs, not a promise to follow moving upstream HEADs.
Build all patched components together: the FFmpeg metadata extension is an ABI change.

The checksummed upstream archives for the patched components are listed
in `tools/check-patches.py`. LibreELEC pins the rest of the distribution, including
its compiler, graphics stack, bootloader, firmware and settings addon.

The recipe/patch installation map is `config/dvbridge-overlay.json`; machine-readable
versions and patch descriptions are in `config/versions.json` and
`config/patch-index.json`. Git tracks normal repository edits. A binary release
separately carries its image receipt and corresponding-source archive inventory.
