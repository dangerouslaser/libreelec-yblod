# Licensing and redistribution

This repository is a collection of patches and build tooling, **not a blanket
relicensing of LibreELEC or its dependencies**. Original copyright and license
notices remain in the resulting source files.

| Material | Applicable terms |
| --- | --- |
| Repository documentation, build/check tooling and original test harness | MIT, except files retaining another explicit notice. |
| Linux as a combined kernel | GPL-2.0-only; Intel display/HDMI files and new policy helpers retain their MIT notices where applicable. |
| FFmpeg source modifications | LGPL-2.1-or-later for the affected source files; the pinned LibreELEC FFmpeg recipe builds with GPL and version3 enabled and declares GPL-3.0-or-later. |
| libplacebo changes | LGPL-2.1-or-later. |
| Existing Kodi integration files | Their original notices, generally GPL-2.0-or-later. |
| Shared transport/rendering helpers and native DV adapter | GPL-3.0-or-later, as marked in their source headers. |
| Combined DV-enabled Kodi build | GPL-3.0-or-later, because it includes those helpers. |
| Other image packages and firmware | Their own upstream terms, recorded by the pinned LibreELEC recipes and retained in the matching source distribution. |

Full primary license texts and retained third-party notices are under
`LICENSES/`. Their canonical hashes are checked by `tools/verify.py`. The existing
Kodi functional patch already includes its combined-build notice and GPLv3
text; no additional licensing-only patch is added by this release preparation.

See [ORIGIN.md](ORIGIN.md) for source credits and derivation. Inherited notices
must not be removed when copying, splitting or renaming the patches. A name
change does not change the license of inherited code.

## Development tools and acknowledgements

The project also acknowledges the following tools and references used during
development. These credits do not imply endorsement or replace the applicable
source licenses and attribution notices.

| Tool or reference | Contribution and licensing context |
| --- | --- |
| [dovi_tool](https://github.com/quietvoid/dovi_tool), by quietvoid and contributors | Public Dolby Vision metadata reference, including the CM4 grammar at revision `d4ad4ba7`. MIT attribution is retained; see [ORIGIN.md](ORIGIN.md). This is an open-source project, not a proprietary Dolby SDK. |
| PGenerator-Plus / ofxRPI4Window, by Riccardo Biasiotto and contributors | Public transport reference inherited through the original implementation. Relevant GPL-3.0-or-later notices are retained; source revisions and derivation are documented in [ORIGIN.md](ORIGIN.md). |
| ChatGPT 6 Astra (OpenAI) | AI assistance with implementation, debugging, code review, test preparation and documentation. Used as a development tool, not a playback component: no OpenAI model or service dependency is included in the release. |

AI assistance does not replace third-party attribution, change upstream license
obligations or constitute an independent certification of the implementation.

## Source and binary releases

The source ZIP contains our patch set, exact recipes, build instructions and
source-verification tools. An image contains many more components; its matching source delivery
must therefore also include the pinned LibreELEC source tree, the exact source
archives used, relevant build scripts/configuration and package notices.

Release images and corresponding source assets together, with the build receipt
and notices included in the source bundle. Keep them available for recipients.
Do not call a patch-only ZIP the complete corresponding source of an entire
LibreELEC image. Check firmware redistribution terms separately from GPL source
obligations. Do not include DRM addons or media in a clean image.

No proprietary Dolby
SDK, confidential specification, content-decryption key or media is included in
the source repository. No official certification or endorsement is claimed.
