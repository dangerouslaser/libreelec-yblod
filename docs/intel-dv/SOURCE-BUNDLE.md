# Corresponding build sources

This source bundle accompanies Intel DV for LibreELEC 0.3.0. It includes:

- The exact pinned upstream LibreELEC Git tree, with its build scripts, package
  recipes, upstream patches and notices. The snapshot is intentionally shallow.
- The additional Intel DV repository, patches, notices and recipe overrides.
- The verified source archive cache used by the build, including build-time
  dependencies and upstream firmware/driver distributions. Unused cached dependencies
  may be present; this is not a minimal software bill of materials.
- The generated Linux kernel configuration and source-content checksums.

The cache contains upstream firmware and the original NVIDIA driver archive
used by the stock Generic build; their individual redistribution terms remain
applicable. The NVIDIA agreement is also available under `third-party-notices/`.
This does not add NVIDIA support to the Intel DV implementation.
The bundle does not contain a Dolby SDK, personal
configuration, media or the build host's compiled toolchain.

## Download and reassemble

For installation or updating, download the image or update archive instead;
this bundle is only needed for source review, rebuilding and redistribution.

Download both `intel-dv-libreelec-0.3.0-complete-sources.tar.part-*` files
from the same release. In an empty directory:

```sh
cat intel-dv-libreelec-0.3.0-complete-sources.tar.part-* > complete-sources.tar
tar -xf complete-sources.tar
cd corresponding-sources
sha256sum --check BUNDLE-SHA256SUMS
```

**Both numbered source parts are required**. Never combine parts from different
releases.

This bundle contains the compatibility, recovery and lightweight diagnostic
patches and recipe snapshot matching the new image.
Upstream licenses remain in the source archives; additional distribution notices
are under `third-party-notices/`. The original rc1 release remains available
separately.

## Reconstruct the source tree

Use a Linux filesystem and install the normal LibreELEC host prerequisites:

```sh
git clone LibreELEC-upstream.git LibreELEC-DV
git -C LibreELEC-DV remote set-url origin https://github.com/LibreELEC/LibreELEC.tv.git
tool_dir=intel-dv-libreelec/tools
# The original 0.1.0-rc1 source snapshot kept its tools at the repository root.
[ -d "$tool_dir" ] || tool_dir=intel-dv-libreelec
python3 "$tool_dir/verify.py"
python3 "$tool_dir/apply-overlay.py" LibreELEC-DV
cp -a sources LibreELEC-DV/sources
cd LibreELEC-DV
PROJECT=Generic ARCH=x86_64 OFFICIAL=no \
  BUILDER_NAME=Intel-DV CUSTOM_VERSION=13.0-intel-dv-0.3.0 \
  CUSTOM_IMAGE_NAME=LibreELEC-Generic.x86_64-13.0-intel-dv-0.3.0 make image
```

The source inputs are fixed; bit-for-bit identical output across different build
hosts is not asserted. Host prerequisites are not bundled. Preserve this source
bundle and notices when redistributing the accompanying binary image.

## Maintainer export

After a successful image build, from the Intel DV repository:

```sh
python3 tools/export-sources.py --tree /path/to/LibreELEC-DV \
  --output /path/to/new-output/corresponding-sources
```

This fails on source-hash drift and refuses an existing output directory. It
does not package private logs, runtime state or media, and never publishes files.
