# Changes by component and file

This index describes the actual exported patches, not an upstream fork history.
Apply patches in filename order within each component. The Kodi patch includes
the shared renderer; its internal files are listed individually below.

### R0.3.0

| Patch | Purpose | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `linux-9904-hdr10-conversion.patch` | Prevent an 8-bit HDMI fallback during HDR10 conversion. | Opt-in connector state reuses existing deep-color selection, including validated YCbCr 4:2:0 where needed. Ordinary Kodi playback does not enable this state. |
| `kodi-9996-output-modes-and-info.patch` | L1-guided HDR10 conversion and optional Player information. | Reuses the layer decoder, FEL renderer and libplacebo spline mapping; adds source-derived reference luminance, 10-bit PQ output, bounded telemetry, native Kodi Player settings and the Estuary panel. |

FFmpeg, libplacebo and the hardware decoder retain their qualified patch series.
The complete index, including each changed file's purpose, is in
`config/patch-index.json`. This release contains 31 patches. LibreELEC Settings is unmodified.

### Static HDR10 metadata during native DV

`kodi-9997-dv-static-metadata-latch.patch` removes a mid-playback DV restart on
streams whose HDR10 mastering and light-level SEI is carried only on the first
IRAP. At the next IRAP the decoder previously reported the frame without static
metadata. Kodi's renderer manager compares that as a format change and rebuilds
the renderer, and renderer teardown ends native DV output. The HDMI signal left
DV and re-entered it (two full modesets, a visible interruption and an HDMI
audio reset) about one GOP after playback started.

For native DV streams the decoder now keeps the last in-band static metadata for
the rest of the stream. A new SEI still replaces it, container metadata is still
the fallback before any SEI has been seen, and state is reset when a stream is
opened. Seeks keep it. Ordinary HDR10, HLG and SDR playback is unchanged.

### Audio sink retry after a failed init

`kodi-9998-activeae-sink-retry.patch` fixes an ActiveAE crash when playback
stops during an HDMI mode change. The sink reopen can fail transiently while
the display changes mode. `Configure()` has then already stored the new request
in `m_sinkRequestFormat`, so the 500 ms retry compares the request with itself,
skips `InitSink()` and configures buffers and resamplers against the stale sink
format (for example the previous passthrough format). Resampler setup fails and
freeing the mismatched buffer pools corrupts the heap (`swr_get_delay()` on a
NULL context, or an abort in `~CActiveAEBufferPool`). Leaving native DV at stop,
followed by the refresh-rate restore, makes this likely.

`Configure()` now reopens the sink on the next attempt after a failed
`InitSink()`, which is what the error-state retry expects. This is a stock Kodi
defect; the change is not DV-specific.

### FEL presentation pairing

`kodi-9993-fel-presentation-pairing.patch` fixes stalls and back-and-forth motion
when FEL and base-layer pictures use different coding orders. FFmpeg's HEVC
parser identifies the corresponding pictures before hardware decoding, with
bounded lookahead and no nearest-frame substitution. Enhancement EOF is reported
in Kodi's log and ends playback cleanly when a file has unmatched trailing base
pictures. DV metadata, pixel processing, GPU rendering and non-DV playback are
unchanged.

After a seek, a bounded FFmpeg header probe locates a base-layer entry point
preceding a recoverable enhancement-layer anchor. Kodi retains the requested
start time and discards preroll through its normal player path. Layer state is
reset and aligned at that anchor rather than assuming both layers share an IDR
boundary. Missing anchors and malformed input are bounded and diagnosed, not
replaced with neighbouring pictures. This changes only eligible native DV seeks;
normal HDR/SDR seek routing is unchanged.

The independently coded test sample now passes repeated seek and uninterrupted
playback checks on the private fel3 image. See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for
the exact scope; these checks do not qualify every possible stream.

### Changes in R0.2.1a-opt1

| Patch | User-visible purpose | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `linux-9902-hdmi-compatibility.patch` | Match valid Standard-DV v0/v1/v2 display signaling. | Shared bounded EDID parser; legacy and modern VSIF use the same safety and transition guards. |
| `kodi-9994-hdmi-recovery.patch` | Align player eligibility and pace persistent HDMI failures. | Independent retry state; immediate early retries, no permanent exclusion, restoration always attempted. |
| `linux-9903-diagnostics.patch` | Preserve link and scanout rejection causes without a log flood. | Per-connector link budget and shared scanout-reason budget. |
| `kodi-9995-diagnostics.patch` | Keep useful DV/kernel facts in the normal Kodi log. | Replaces 9991/9992 from a clean functional baseline; bounded automatic reports, no global debug requirement. |

The release retains existing opt1 optimizations and the 9993 FEL correction.
Old Kodi 9991/9992 and Linux 9902 diagnostic patches are removed. FFmpeg,
libplacebo, shaders and common DV metadata/pixel-processing helpers are unchanged.
For per-file details and removal boundaries, see [patches/README.md](../patches/README.md).

## linux

The new diagnostics are separate from sink compatibility and HDMI serialization.

## kodi

Kodi 9994 holds compatibility/retry changes. The independently removable 9995
holds lightweight diagnostics; its counters never drive playback decisions.

## LibreELEC recipes

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/mediacenter/kodi/package.mk` | Build/link libplacebo and enable the native DV adapter; retain the applicable combined-build license declaration; normalize embedded build paths. |
| `packages/addons/addon-depends/multimedia-tools-depends/libplacebo/package.mk` | Pin the tested libplacebo revision, enable DV/GLES and build a shared target library; normalize embedded build paths. |

No LibreELEC Settings or systemd activation service modification is included. The optional Estuary information panel is part of the Kodi output patch.
The separate HDR10 precision retry is not a DV metadata or tone-mapping change.

## Kernel diagnostics in Kodi

`kodi-9995-diagnostics.patch` includes the removable background logging hook:

- `DRMAtomic.cpp`: request kernel evidence only after a bounded DV output failure.
- `DVBridgeKernelLog.h`: parse kernel records; exclude userspace, stale, duplicate and unrelated messages.
- `DVBridgeKernelLogReader.h`: read the kernel ring without blocking rendering or clearing the system log.

`DVBRIDGE_DIAGNOSTICS=0` disables the added Kodi supplement. The separate
compatibility/recovery patches are unaffected. See [DIAGNOSTICS.md](DIAGNOSTICS.md).
